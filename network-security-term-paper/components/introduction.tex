\section{Introduction}
\label{sub:introduction}
Software development is ever changing, as we shift away from traditional monolithic Virtual Machine deployments to a more microservice container deployment the security aspects around applications change. Today applications consist of 'n' number of containers, this alone significantly enlarges the potential attack surface \citep{bryk_2018}.

This paper looks toward this attack surface and tries to identify potential vulnerabilities and security challenges with Open Container Initiative compliant containers. Based on the findings from the report a guide will be constructed outlining a number of industry standard best practices when working with containers, this guide will be discussed in detail in Section \ref{sub:summary}.
