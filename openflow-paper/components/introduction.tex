\section{Introduction}
This paper discusses the work carried out during the Openflow Firewall Assignment, some background information is also given to demonstrate overall understanding of Software Defined Networks.

The practical element looked at building on a Learning Switch to add Firewall rules to create block flows in the Switch. These rules where read from a CSV file and both MAC address filtering and also IP address filtering are implemented. Finally we look at the Transport Layer by blocking port numbers.
