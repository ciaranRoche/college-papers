A very special gratitude goes to my supervisor Dr. Rosanne Birney for her advice and guidance through out this semester. Without it my project would not be where it is today. I also wish to extend my gratitude to the entire computing staff, who gave me the drive and motivation needed to push myself beyond my abilities.

My sincere thanks to Dr. Leigh Griffin, Aiden Keating, Laura Fitzgerald and the entire team at Red Hat Waterford. Their guidance and support throughout my internship and extending to my project has been incredible. Giving me not only the knowledge and tools needed for my final year of college but to progress my career in this field.

To all my family, without their encouragement and support I would not be writing this today. For that I will be forever grateful.

And finally, last but by no means least my fellow students. Their collaboration and friendship has made my time at WIT a memorable one. I wish you all the best in your FYP's and your future careers.
