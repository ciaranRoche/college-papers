\begin{abstract}
    Modern cloud centric computing has seen a number of technologies and approaches emerge as candidates for auto-inclusion in development stacks. In particular,  Kubernetes and developing for a serverless world are fast becoming the de facto way of working as their benefits are clear. Simple, yet clever configurations can bring unrivalled scalability, coupled with huge cost saving over the lifecycle of a service. These are among the primary drivers for attracting developers towards this paradigm. However, the barriers to entry for serverless development are high. There exists a steep learning curve as well as mundane scaffolding which obscures the valuable configurations developers should be focusing on.  RubiX is an Open Source Framework aimed at reducing the barrier of entry to serverless development on Knative, the Kubernetes-based platform to build, deploy, and manage modern serverless workloads. Using RubiX, a developer can focus on their functions, with the freedom to develop in a fluid manner, using a number of SDK's which support multiple languages. This allows developers to focus on the real problems at hand and take advantage of being able to deploy in a serverless world.
